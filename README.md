This is a storage of my repositories that are obsolete or promote bad coding practices.

The code is only useful for "how not to" and "how it was done before X".

### Why not store in as a "private archive" at [artginzburg](https://github.com/artginzburg)?

- There's no personal data or important intellectual property in these repositories, hence they're not private.
- Archived repositories still show up in search and count towards the repository counter visible in profile.
Storing them in another "organization" helps declutter the main profile, whilst still having the repos available to anyone.
- [artginzburg](https://github.com/artginzburg)'s archive is a place for repos that are deprecated or unmaintained, but not "obsolete or promote bad coding practices".
